# block and plot are the same between the dataframes
# column and row are defined differently in the two datasets
# I will use an X, Y grid to convert between the two
# The phenotypes data frame already has an X, Y grid of columns (1-14) and rows (1-6)
# this is starting at column 1, row 1 in the upper left hand corner of an image
# this corresponds to the Southwest corner of each plot in AtSha_col2014plotdesign.png
# first I will deal with the rows
# I thought initially of changing 2 things at once, hence the ifelse, but thought it 
# also confusing without looking at AtSha_col2014plotdesign.png, so here is my attempt

#copy column to change in place
# make numeric so the ifelse will change correctly
